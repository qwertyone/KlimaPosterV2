#work strategies 1) reduce heat source 2) convective heat control 3) radiant heat control 4) evaporative heat control
# 1) limit exposure time and/or temprature, 2) reduce metabolic heat load (i.e. automation, job redesign), 3) enhance tolerance time (exercise, fitness, electrolyte balance), 4) health and safety training
# 5) screen for heat intolerance (medical history, physical unfitness
